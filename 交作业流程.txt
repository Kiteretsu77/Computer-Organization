Before everthing: Make sure that you open the VPN if you are off campus
1.In terminal, "cd" to your datalab-handout position
2.Use command: scp bits.c bwang48@cycle1.csug.rochester.edu:~/bits.c (Upload code first, it's better to upload code into a folder) （In terminal not cycle machine）
3.Use command:  ssh bwang48@cycle1.csug.rochester.edu  (This is login)
4.Make sure the bits.c is in a folder. If not, the following command will fail
5.Use command: /u/cs252/bin/TURN_IN .  (Don't forget the dot at the end)
6.The screen will require you to input "your partner's netid" That is your NetID not others.
7.If your code is successfully submitted, you will receive a confirmation email on your official UR email acount. That email will say:
